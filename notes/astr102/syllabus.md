LECTURES & TEXT
===============

For the most part, the lectures will follow Chapters 16 – 27 of Astronomy Today (7th Edition) by Chaisson & McMillan.  Chapters 1 – 15 and 28 were covered inASTR 101: Introduction to Astronomy: The Solar System.  The lectures are meant to highlight and supplement the material in the text, but not replace it:  Please read each chapter before it is covered in class (see Course Webpage and Course Calendar below).  You are responsible for the material covered in both the lectures and the text. There is material from ASTR 101 that you will be expected to remember and use, so you may wish to review some of the earlier chapters in the book.

COURSE WEBPAGE
---------------

ASTR 102 is divided into nine lessons.  Each lesson’s reading assignment
and supplementary notes can be found on the course webpage:

[https://sakai.unc.edu/portal/site/astr102.001.sp13](https://sakai.unc.edu/portal/site/astr102.001.sp13)

You will need to login with your ONYEN to access the course page.

WEBASSIGN
=========

Homeworks will be administered through Webassign.  Go to [http://www.webassign.com](http://www.webassign.com/),  create an account if you do not already have one, and add this course.  The course key for Spring 2013 is *unc 2042 5115*

PLEASE NOTE: If you are creating a new account, please consider using your ONYEN as your user name and enter your UNC student ID when enrolling.  This enables me to more easily match your grades on assignments with grades on exams.

GRADES
------

90% is not an A, 80% is not a B, etc.  Final grades will be assigned on a curve at the end of the semester. I will let you know how you did in comparison to your classmates after each homework and exam.  For example, a recent class ended the semester with 24% A’s, 56% B’s, 12% C’s, 2.5% D’s, and 4.8% F’s.  Results may differ this semester.  All that matters is how well you do compared to your classmates.

Homeworks count for 1/3 of your final grade.  Homeworks will be made available through Webassign in advance of covering the material in class and will always be due at 9:00 AM (see the course webpage for exact due dates).  After submitting homework, check and make sure that Webassign received all of your answers before logging off.  Late homeworks will not be accepted without a medical excuse.  There will be nine homeworks total.  Your worst performance will be dropped.

Exams count for 2/3 of your final grade.  Exams will be given in class (see Course Calendar below for dates).  The final, which will be cumulative but with an emphasis placed on recent material, will count as two exams.  Your worst performance will be dropped, unless it is the final, in which case the final will count the same as a midterm.  Makeup exams will not be given without a medical excuse.  Exams will be closed book, but you are allowed to bring one sheet of notes, front and back.  You are required to bring a UNC Chapel Hill Office of Information TechnologyGeneral Purpose Answer Sheet (scantron form), a \#2 pencil, and a scientific calculator.  An important note: you may not use your smartphone as a calculator.  You must use an actual calculator.  Using a smartphone for any reason during an exam will result in a failing grade on the exam and a trip to the honor court.

LABS
====

ASTR 101L: Introduction to Astronomy Laboratory: Our Place in Space is a separate 1-credit course that parallels the ASTR 101/102 sequence.  You are not required to take the lab, although you can use it to fulfill your General College laboratory requirement.

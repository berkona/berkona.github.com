Spectroscopic Inspection of Nebulae
------------------------------------

Forbidden Lines, OIII spectrum lines.  They are called forbidden b/c they can't replicate in a lab. It is caused by oxygen being ionized twice (losing two valence electrons).  We can't observe doubly ionize oxygen in a lab b/c the density of the oxygen in the best vacuum chamber in a lab that the oxygen will collide with another oxygen atom before it can drop an energy level and emit a photon.  The gas in OIII emission nebulae is so rarefied that it can spontaneous drop down to a lower level from the OIII state.  OIII emissions aren't generally visible (i.e., observable only in spectroscopy), but when it is it glows green.


Proto-stellar Evolution
-----------------------

If the mass of a proto-stellar object is below .08 solar masses then it isn't dense enough to start burning hydrogen in fusion.  Very low mass objects such as Jupiter (1/1000 solar mass) generally don't burn, but there are objects such as brown dwarfs.  Brown dwarfs don't burn hydrogen.

Brown Dwarfs
------------

Generally they start at a certain temperature and gradually cool (i.e., over 10 billion years).

Red Giants
-----------

Gradually the star goes from burning hydrogen at the core and start burning the shell.  The core is a non-burning dense helium 'ash.'  Once shell burning starts, it swells 5-10 times larger than it used to be b/c it is putting out more luminosity over time.  Because L ~= R^2 * T^4, as the radius increases the surface temperature reduces.  The core temperature increases several times due to the shell burning occurring.  After the sub-giant branch, it goes from 3 solar radii to 100 solar radii.

When the core temperature reaches to 100E6 K, the Helium Flash occurs, and the helium begins to fuse.  Hydrogen burning still occurs in the shell.  This reaction is referred to as the triple-&alpha; reaction.  The helium burning does not burn steadily as hydrogen does b/c by the time the helium starts the burn, the density at the center of the star is ~ 10,000 times the density of water.

At a certain threshold of pressure that the gas/ plasma in the star phase-shifts to a liquid because of the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This phase is called a degenerate electron liquid.  This gas is interested because the electrons have pressure b/c they called become closer.  This pressure is called Electron Degeneracy Pressure.

Red giants develop an onion-skin arrangement of elements in the star, with the heavier elements towards the center of the core.  Helium burning creates an ash ball of carbon.  If the temperature of the core isn't below 600E6 K, it cannot burn the carbon into oxygen.  As all the helium is converted to carbon in the core, the star begins to burn helium in a shell around the core.  After this, the core is an ash ball of carbon, and there are two shells: one burning hydrogen and one burning helium.  This branch of star evolution is termed the asymptotic giant branch.

Once it reaches a certain temp, it can burn carbon with helium into oxygen.  This can only occur when there is electron degeneracy liquid.  This creates a series of explosions inside the star.


Nebulae
-------

As you go up the asymptotic branch, the explosions become strong enough that the star starts to pulse (in radius) and ejects gas into the interstellar medium.  This stage of evolution is termed a nebula or planetary nebula.  The term planetary nebula came from the fact that early astronomers could only make out a fuzzy gas cloud at first, similar to what you see when you look at a gas giant such as Neptune.  Even though the nebula is a sphere of gas, it often looks like a ring b/c we see through more of the hot, glowing gas at the edges of the object.

Nebula tend to have a hotter surface temperature because at a certain point most of the outer gas has shed, and you begin to see the hot inner core.

White Dwarfs
--------------

As the core cools down from 100,000+ K to 10,000 K, it is now termed a white dwarf.  White dwarfs aren't very active in terms of size or temperature, but rather gradually cool.

MISC

Triple-&alpha; reaction
: 4^He + 4^He + 4^He &rarr; 12^C

Carbon-Helium reaction
: C-12 + H-4 &rarr; O-16

Mass rule of thumb
: star > 0.08 solar mass > brown dwarf > 0.0012 solar mass > planetary object

Cloud Properties
================

Gas clouds are very sparse, but very large and stellar distances are great
so it can form hundreds of 1000's of stars and occlude a lot of light.

How do we see them?
-------------------

Gas clouds glow under spectra other than visible light.  Why? Transitions occur
inside cloud that emit radiation.  Spin-flip transition of an electron in
neutral hydrogen emits 21 cm photon radiation. Faster vibration to slower vibration
also emits photon radiation as does faster to slower rotation of molecules.

How do they stay together/separate
------------------------------------

In the interstellar medium, the gas physics is somewhat different that gas law.
Gases can radiate energy into space, lowering its gas pressure.  Gas regions
can drop out relative to the main cloud.  Cloud fragmentation leads to

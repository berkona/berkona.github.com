# Formation of Neutron Stars #
- Iron core held up by Electron Degeneracy Pressure
- Neutralization causes iron core to become mostly neutrons, held up by NDP
- Since neutrons are heavier than electrons, the density required for that pressure is much greater, so the neutron star is much denser
- Most pressure holding up a neutron star is NDP & strong nuclear force
- Balance between gravitation force & NDP/strong force

# What Happens at greater Densities? #
- Neutron stars can be in a binary system
- Mass transfer can increase angular velocity & mass of n-star
- As you add more mass to n-star, it grows smaller and there is a Chandrasekhar-like limit for n-stars
- As gravity overcomes NDP, there is no new equilibrium for the falling star
- All material falls towards being a single point
- Forms a hugely dense core.
- Event horizon: boundary between when you can access the outside universe and when you can no longer communicate with the outside world.
- Why? Escape Velocity. The escape speed is > than speed of light
- V_esc = sqrt( 2*G*M / R ) or V_esc ~= sqrt ( 2*M / R)
- Earth's escape speed is 11 km/s
- Black holes can also be formed by sufficiently heavy stars collapsing
- If the mass of the star is above or around 25 solar masses, the iron core collapses and doesn't find a stable point when NDP sets in.

# Special Relativity #
- Merger of Newtonian treatment of motion with electromagnetism
- Uses absolute motion of light (light always moves at the same velocity) instead of absolute time
- The laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame
- An inertial frame is any non-accelerated frame of reference
- An object at motion from one frame is at rest from the opposite frame
- Motion is relative to the frame of reference
- The speed of light is the same in every inertial frame

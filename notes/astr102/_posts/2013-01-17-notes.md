## Corona
- Very high temp: ~ 1 million degrees K
- Completely different from other layers of the sun
- Low density, white color
- How diffuse is it?
	- 1 liter of water over a sphere the size of the earth
- Temperature is high, but not much heat (too diffuse)
- Emits high energy radiation (way above visible light)

### Heat vs. Temp
- Temp: avg. kinetic energy (in a gas, actual motion)
	- high temp = fast moving particles
- Heat: energy transferred by collisions

### Why is it hot?
- We don't quite know, we have some ideas:
	-
- Transitions from 6000 K to 1 million K

## Solar magnetic fields
- 2 million tons of matter per second
	- Trivial compared to total mass of the sun
	- Only about 0.1% has boiled off
- Some field lines extend into space, some loop back around
- On a large scale the solar wind looks constant, but it varies over time

## Sun spots
- All told cooler than the surface of the sun
- Umbra is the darkest & coolest (~4500K) spot of sunspot
- Penumbra is the lighter & hotter (~4800K) gray part
- Caused by magnetic fields
- Material flows between an outward-facing sunspot to an inward-facing sunspot
- Emits Synchrotron emission, sunspots are very radio loud
- Sunspots happen in pairs

### Why do they happen?

- When look at the spectrum of a sunspot, they have 2 more emission lines than the rest of the sun

- Relates to quantum physics:
	- spin-up vs spin-down
	- W/o magnetic field, electrons keep their spin
	- W/ a magnetic field, electrons can change their spin
	- This results in 2 ground states & 2 excited states (4 possible emissions), but spin-up & spin-down are the same energy.  Thus, there are multiple absorption lines

- The magnetic field of the sun at the sun spot is entirely perpendicular to the sun -- It either comes straight out of the sun or straight into the sun

- The magnetic field affects the charged particles in the sun

- Magnetic field suppresses convection, so the sun spot cools down
	- Particles spiral around magnetic field lines

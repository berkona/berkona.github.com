## Corona
- Very high temp: ~ 1 million&deg;K
- Completely different from other layers of the sun
- Low density, white color
- How diffuse is it?
	- 1 liter of water over a sphere the size of the earth
- Temperature is high, but not much heat (too diffuse)
- Emits high energy radiation (way above visible light)
- Size & energy of corona varies by solar activity

### Heat vs. Temp
- Temp: avg. kinetic energy (in a gas, actual motion)
	- high temp = fast moving particles
- Heat: energy transferred by collisions

### Why is it hot?
- We don't quite know, we have some ideas:
	- Both prominences & flares heat the corona
- Transitions from 6000&deg;K to 1 million&deg;K

## Solar magnetic fields
- 2 million tons of matter per second
	- Trivial compared to total mass of the sun
	- Only about 0.1% has boiled off
- Some field lines extend into space, some loop back around
- On a large scale the solar wind looks constant, but it varies over time
- 22 year cycle of the sun's field lines flipping
- Sunspot cycles occur over the rising and failing of this cycle (i.e., twice per cycle)

## Sun spots
- All told cooler than the surface of the sun
- Umbra is the darkest & coolest (~4500&deg;K) spot of sunspot
- Penumbra is the lighter & hotter (~4800&deg;K) gray part
- Caused by magnetic fields
- Material flows between an outward-facing sunspot to an inward-facing sunspot
- Emits Synchrotron emission, sunspots are very radio loud
- Sunspots happen in pairs
- Sunspots occur between 40&deg N; and 40&deg; S
- Minimum occurs at 40&deg; N/S
- Maximum occurs at 20&deg; N,S

### Why do they happen?

- When look at the spectrum of a sunspot, they have 2 more emission lines than the rest of the sun

- Relates to quantum physics:
	- spin-up vs spin-down
	- W/o magnetic field, electrons keep their spin
	- W/ a magnetic field, electrons can change their spin
	- This results in 2 ground states & 2 excited states (4 possible emissions), but spin-up & spin-down are the same energy.  Thus, there are multiple absorption lines

- The magnetic field of the sun at the sun spot is entirely perpendicular to the sun -- It either comes straight out of the sun or straight into the sun

- The magnetic field affects the charged particles in the sun

- Magnetic field suppresses convection, so the sun spot cools down
	- Particles spiral around magnetic field lines

- The sun is mainly composed of a gas:
	- Doesn't rotate as a perfect body, rotates differentially
	- Equator rotates faster than poles
	- Drags on the magnetic lines, causing kinks
	- Eventually they break from the main lines & create sunspots

### Sunspot History
- Discovered around 1600-1700 AD. This was during a period known as the Maudner minimum, a period of reduced solar activity

- We know there are prolonged periods of minimal activity, but no prolonged periods of maximum activity


## Prominences
- Material traveling along magnetic field lines that will fall back down to surface of the sun
- Hotter than the surface of the sun

## Solar Flares
- These particles are flung off with such force that they overcome the magnetic field of the sun
- Material that makes up the solar win
- Even hotter than prominences

## Coronal Mass Ejections
- Somewhat like a flare, but magnetically contained
- Magnetic fields twist such that a bubble of charged gas is ejected from the sun
- Happens ~ once a week to several a day depending on solar activity
- Magnetic field of CME can join with the magnetic field of the Earth
- Charged particles follow magnetic lines down to the atmosphere of the Earth, creating radiation as they impact the particles in the atmosphere

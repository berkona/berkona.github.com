# Sun Composition

## Corona
- Very high temp: ~ 1 million degrees K
- Completely different from other layers of the sun
- Low density, white color
- How diffuse is it?
	- 1 liter of water over a sphere the size of the earth
- Temperature is high, but not much heat (too diffuse)
- Emits high energy radiation (way above visible light)


### Heat vs. Temp
- Temp: avg. kinetic energy (in a gas, actual motion)
	- high temp = fast moving particles
- Heat: energy transferred by collisions

### Why is it hot?
- We don't quite know, we have some ideas:
- Transitions from 6000 K to 1 million K

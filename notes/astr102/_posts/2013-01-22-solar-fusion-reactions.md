## Proton-Proton Chain Reaction ##

Fusion reaction combines protons into energy, positrons,
Helium-4, and neutrinos.

1. Two protons collide a weak-interaction scale producing a deuterium, a positron, and an electron neutrino:

> p+ + p+ &rarr; H-2 + e+ + nu-e

2. The positron almost immediately runs into an electron and annihilates, producing energy (2 gamma rays):

> e+ + e- &rarr; 2 ph

3. The electron neutrino, which only interacts with weak-force and gravity, escapes the sun without running into anything

4. Deuterium and a proton collide producing Helium-3 and a gamma ray (a photon)

> H-2 + p+ &rarr; He-3 + ph

5. 2 Helium-3 combines to become helium-4 & 2 protons

> He-3 + He-3 &rarr; He-4 + 2 p+

6. The overall reaction:

> 6 p+ &rarr; He-4 + 2 p+ + 2 e+ + 2 nu-e + 2 ph;


### CNO cycle ###
Trace amounts of carbon & nitrogen are not fused in the
core, but are used as nuclear catalysts. Used in transition
states, but then goes back to its raw form

### Relative Energies ###
Proton-proton energy production is greater than CNO energy
release in our sun, but increased can overwhelm p-p
reactions over 15 million &deg;K

- 4 P &rarr; Helium-4: mass difference = 0.048 * 10 <sup>-27</sup> kg
- 600 million tons of hydrogen into ~ 600 million tons per second
- ~ 4.3 million tons of hydrogen goes into energy

## Distant Stars ##
- Properties of stars
  - distance
  - radius
  - temperature
  - mass of star
  - luminosity
  - chemical composition

### How do you determine the distance? ###
- AUs
  : average distance between sun & earth
- Nearest star: ~100,000 AUs away
- Using geometry w/ parallax
  - Move a given distance, measure the angle between the two spots
- Parallax in astronomy:
  - measurement 1: Earth in July
  - measurement 2: Earth in Jan
  - equals distance of 2 AUs
- The closer the start, the larger the shift relative to the background
- For small angles: tan &theta; ~~ &theta;
- Must use radians for this approximation to work
- for radians:
  - tan p = (1 AU / p) or for small p, p ~= (1 AU / d)
- for seconds of arc:
  - d = (206,265 AU / p)
- d = r / p is a new unit: a parsec (AUs per arc second)
- 1 parsec ~~ 3.3 light years

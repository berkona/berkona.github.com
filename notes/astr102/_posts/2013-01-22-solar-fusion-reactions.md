## Proton-Proton Chain Reaction ##

Fusion reaction combines protons into energy, positrons,
Helium-4, and neutrinos.

1. 	Two protons collide a weak-interaction scale producing a deuterium, a positron, and an electron neutrino:
		<sup>1</sup>H + <sup>1</sup>H &rarr; <sup>2</sup>H + e<sup>+</sup> + &nu;<sub>e</sub>

2.	The positron almost immediately runs into an electron and annihilates, producing energy (2 gamma rays):
		e<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup> &rarr; 2&gamma;

3.	The electron neutrino, which only interacts with weak-force and gravity, escapes the sun without running into anything

4.	Deuterium and a proton collide producing Helium-3 and a gamma ray (a photon)
		<sup>2</sup>H + <sup>1</sup>H &rarr; <sup>3</sup>He + &gamma;

5.  2 Helium-3 combines to become helium-4 & 2 protons
		<sup>3</<sup>He + <sup>3</sup>He &rarr; <sup>4</sup>He + 2(<sup>1</sup>H)

6.  The overall reaction:
		6(<sup>1</sup>H) &rarr; <sup>4</sup>He + 2(<sup>1</sup>H) + 2e<sup>+</sup> + 2&nu;<sub>e</sub> + 2&gamma;





### CNO cycle ###
Trace amounts of carbon & nitrogen are not fused in the
core, but are used as nuclear catalysts. Used in transition
states, but then goes back to its raw form

### Relative Energies ###
Proton-proton energy production is greater than CNO energy
release in our sun, but increased can overwhelm p-p
reactions over 15 million &deg;K

- 4 P &rarr; Helium-4: mass difference = 0.048 * 10<sup>-27</sup> kg
- 600 million tons of hydrogen into ~ 600 million tons per second
- ~ 4.3 million tons of hydrogen goes into energy

## Distant Stars ##
- Properties of stars
	- distance
	- radius
	- temperature
	- mass of star
	- luminosity
	- chemical composition

### How do you determine the distance? ###
- AUs
	: average distance between sun & earth
- Nearest star: ~100,000 AUs away
- Using geometry w/ parallax
	- Move a given distance, measure the angle between the two spots
- Parallax in astronomy:
	- measurement 1: Earth in July
	- measurement 2: Earth in Jan
	- equals distance of 2 AUs
- The closer the start, the larger the shift relative to the background
- For small angles: tan &theta; ~~ &theta;
- Must use radians for this approximation to work
- for radians:
	- `tan p = (1 AU / p)` or for small p `p = (1 AU / d)
- for seconds of arc:
	- `d = (206,265 AU / p)`
- `d = r / p` is a new unit: a parsec (AUs per arc second)
- 1 parsec ~~ 3.3 light years

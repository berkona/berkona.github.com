White Dwarf
------------

Composed of electron degenerate matter.  How common are they?  If the star's initial mass is less than 8 solar masses, the star will always become a white dwarf.  If it's heavier than that, it would form a neutron star or, with a supernova, a black hole.  Therefore, white dwarfs are relatively common.

Most common place to find them is a globular star cluster.  A globular star cluster is bound by gravity into a rough sphere.

M ~= 0.6 solar masses
R ~= 0.01 solar radii

Example: Sirius B

White Dwarf
============

Composed of electron degenerate matter.  How common are they?  If the star's initial mass is less than 8 solar masses, the star will always become a white dwarf.  If it's heavier than that, it would form a neutron star or, with a supernova, a black hole.  Therefore, white dwarfs are relatively common.

M ~= 0.6 solar masses
R ~= 0.01 solar radii

Example: Sirius B

Globular Star Clusters
=======================

Most common place to find them is a globular star cluster.  A globular star cluster is bound by gravity into a rough sphere.  The turn-off point of the main sequence helps tell how long ago a star cluster formed.

Binary Star Systems
====================

There are two Roche Lobes around each star.  Somewhat teardrop-shaped.  Somewhat like a figure-eight shape when viewed together.  Roche lobes determine places where a free-floating object would be bound to that object.  As long as the Roche Lobes are greater than the surface of the star, then the gases of the star are bound to the star.  Once the star swells in size, it can exceed its Roche Lobe.  It then takes on the shape of the Roche Lobe.  Once it exceeds the Roche Lobe, you have mass spill over via the Lagrange Point into the Roche Lobe of the companion star.  This mass-transfer can result in the lighter star becoming the heavier star in the system.  This mass increase accelerates the star's aging.  This results in both stars being giants at once.  Thus, the two stars can fill there Roche Lobes and merge into one single envelope.

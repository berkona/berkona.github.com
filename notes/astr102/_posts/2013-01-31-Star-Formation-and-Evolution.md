Galactic core glows b/c we can't see the difference between stars.  Disc of the
Milky Way Galaxy is ~ 200 pc.  Distance to core is 8000 pc.  Extra-galactic
entities such as the Magellanic Cloud is ~ 60,000 pc away.

## Dark Dust Clouds ##

Dust clouds preferentially scatters blue light more than red light.  Dust clouds
occlude most visible light, but one can still see stars through the cloud via
infrared b/c it is redder.  Similar to the effect of a sunset/ sunrise on the earth.

Dark clouds require neutral, cold atomic hydrogen in the ground state.
Temp ~100 K.  If all the hydrogen is the ground state, it wouldn't be visible.

The ground state of hydrogen isn't exactly a single state/line.  There are two
possible ground states.  This transition is called a hyper-fine transition or
hyper-fine line (for the emission line).

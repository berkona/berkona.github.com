Galactic core glows b/c we can't see the difference between stars.  Disc of the
Milky Way Galaxy is ~ 200 pc.  Distance to core is 8000 pc.  Extra-galactic
entities such as the Magellanic Cloud is ~ 60,000 pc away.

The galactic core is bulging at the center b/c at least 10% of the stars in the
galaxy.  Dark lines around the core are gas clouds on line with our view of the
core.

Physics 101:
- Small radius, less rotational inertia, faster rotation
- Large radius, more rotational inertia, slower rotation


## Dark Dust Clouds ##

Dust clouds preferentially scatters blue light more than red light.  Dust clouds
occlude most visible light, but one can still see stars through the cloud via
infrared b/c it is redder.  Similar to the effect of a sunset/ sunrise on the earth.

Dark clouds require neutral, cold atomic hydrogen in the ground state.
Temp ~100 K.  If all the hydrogen is the ground state, it wouldn't be visible.

The ground state of hydrogen isn't exactly a single state/ line.  There are two
possible ground states.  This transition is called a hyper-fine transition or
hyper-fine line (for the emission line).

## Molecular Clouds ##

Clouds that are composed of various molecules such as CO_2

## Gas Clouds ##

A cloud might begin spinning b/c gravity can torque a spinning object, which
causes the object torquing the spinning object to gain angular momentum. If a
dust cloud spins generally, it falls along the spin axis b/c it is opposed by
the force of the spinning cloud.

There are always a small amount of ionized particles in interstellar space.
The gas conducts electricity.  Therefore, the cloud interacts with the magnetic
field of the interstellar space.  The magnetic field of a dust cloud is ~ 1E-6
of the Earth's.  As the cloud contracts, it compresses the field lines. This
exerts pressure on the field lines, creating magnetic tension in the field
line.  These forces attempt to dissipate the cloud.  Dust cloud gas can move
along the field lines, causing the cloud to flatten over time.

Cosmic rays (high-energy particles in space) can also interact with the
magnetic field, causing an inward pressure on the cloud.

Gas clouds are an unstable system.  Once the field lines go into under-dense
areas, it tends to break the cloud up into smaller, denser clouds

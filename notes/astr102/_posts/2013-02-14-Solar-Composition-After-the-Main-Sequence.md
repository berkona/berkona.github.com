After a while, large stars start fusing carbon, oxygen, neon, magnesium, and silicon.  The only true ash component is iron (i.e., iron-group elements). Iron is the turning point of the fusion/ fission.  Fusion reactions above Iron-group require energy to fuse rather than release energy.

The brightness of a galaxy is comparable to the brightness of a supernova.

# Novae or Classical Novae #

Related to white dwarf stars.  Can give a white dwarf a second chance.  Once its companion stars fills its Roche lobe, it begins to transfer mass. The increase of hydrogen causes instant fusion to occur on the surface, throwing off a portion of the star's surface. At this point, the star explodes in a nova, where the luminosity increases by a factor of 10,000 over the course of a few days and lasts for about a month.  Some novae only happen once, but others recur periodically after the companion star refills its Roche lobe.

# Type II Supernovae #

It will produce a type II supernova.  The core of the massive star begins to be composed mostly of iron.  There comes a point where the size of the iron core is greater than a solar mass itself.  When the density is ~ 1E9 times water and the temperature is about 1E9 K, the process reverses.

The high temperature allows gamma rays to 'smash' or split up iron particles into 14 He. If the temperature is even hotter, the gamma ray can split He into 2 neutrons and 2 protons.  In a matter of a second, the iron gets busted up into Helium and into neutrons and protons.  This is an exothermic reaction, so where is the energy coming from? Gravitation potential energy.

As the core shrinks in size, the gravitation energy becomes heat which increases the speed of the reaction.  This shrinking causes a chain reaction where the core keeps shrinking and smashing more iron.  Electrons and protons interact to form a neutron and an electron neutrino.  Since electrons provide the pressure for the star, the star shrinks in size as its electrons are depleted.  The star continues to collapse until it shrinks to a radius of ~10 km.  This means the density goes from 1E9 to 1E15 the density of water.

The density of the core creates an neutron degeneracy liquid (since they are fermions and cannot occupy the same quantum state.  See Pauli Exclusion Principle).  The pressure of the neutron degeneracy pressure causes the core to 'bounce back' to a slightly larger.  This creates a shock-wave that pushes the gas falling into the core out.  The shock-wave goes through the entire material of the collapsing star and ejects it to interstellar space.

# Type I Supernovae #

Completely different reaction, but puts out about the same energy as a type II supernova.  A type I supernova is associated with a white dwarf in a binary star system.  Helium gets added to the carbon-oxygen core of the white dwarf.  This process lasts for a long time, but eventually it can greatly increase the mass of the white dwarf.  This only happens if the mass-transfer is slow enough that the hydrogen/ helium doesn't immediately ignite b/c of the speed of the transfer.

The more mass the star has, the more gravity the core has and the more energy is applied to compress the core.  Electron degenerate liquid is mostly incompressible, but you can compress it with enough force.  The more mass you add to the white dwarf.  Because of the nature of the gas, as you add mass the star's radius decreases (counter intuitive, yes).

At ~1.4 solar masses, the is a cutoff point called the Chrandrasekhar mass.  At 1.4 solar masses, the radius is so small that it is almost 0.  At this point, the carbon and oxygen are compressed enough that they can start fusing.  Very quickly after that, the magnesium produce burns, and so on until iron-group elements.  All this happens in about a second or so.  This causes a giant explosion of energy.  It starts in the core (where it's densest), and creates a burning front, which burns through the rest of the fuel left in the star and leaves a bunch of iron ash.  This is equivalent to a bunch of H-bombs going off at once.

A)

T = 8F + 8h
d = T / R
total = d * N

total = ( (8F + 8h)/R ) * M

B)

packet = 8P + 8h
total_size = M * packet
total_time = total_size / R

total = ( N * ( M * (8P * 8h) ) ) / R

P = F/M
M = F/L

total = ( M * (8F * 8h) ) / R

C)

total_time T_a + trans_time
trans_time = total_size / R
total_size = M * packet
packet = 8P + 4h

D)

total_time = T_a + trans_time
trans_time = total_size / R
total_size = 8F + 4h

E)

When F is much greater than size of P.  Whenever there is a lossy connection between A and B.  When there is delay between transmissions between A and B.

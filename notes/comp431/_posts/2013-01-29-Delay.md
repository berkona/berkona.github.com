## Per-Hop Delay ("nodal delay") ##

What is the delay of the internet?  Nobody knows.  Some researchers have done research on edge systems and on how universities connect to the internet.
Even these sort of networks are massive and variable.  No one really knows how much queuing delay occurs overall in the internet.

d_nodal = d_proc + d_queue + d_trans + d_prop

d_proc = processing delay - typically a few microseconds or less

d_queue = queuing delay (La/R) - depends on congestion

q_trans = transmission delay (L/R) - signficant for low-speed links

d_prop = propagation delay - a few microseconds to hundreds of milliseconds (depends on # of nodes)


## Internet Traffic Measurements & Models ##

What dominates end-to-end delay?  It is largely a function of the # of routers encountered along the path from source to destination.  Router delay
is equivalent to d_nodal

How do you measure it?  Capture every TCP/IP packet header on the link between two networks, i.e., UNC and the internet.  1 hour trace for 1Gbps is ~= 30+ GB file.
Store, sort, process terabytes of data to find the connections that have occured.  Good questions: how long is each packet delay?  How variable is the delay?

d_queue dominates d_nodal on the internet.  d_prop and d_trans over a given connection rarely change.  d_proc can change, but it isn't a huge contributer.

Remember that all rates are averages.  Even on a 10 millisecond timeframe, instant packet rate can shoot up a large amount.
